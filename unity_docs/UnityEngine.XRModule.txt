Description


The XR module contains the VR and AR related platform support functionality.






Classes








Class


Description






CommonUsages
Defines static variables that are used to retrieve input features from XR.InputDevice.TryGetFeatureValue.


InputDevices
An interface for accessing devices in the XR input subsytem.


InputTracking
A collection of methods and properties for accessing XR input devices by their XR Node representation.


XRDisplaySubsystem
An XRDisplaySubsystem controls rendering to a head tracked display.


XRDisplaySubsystemDescriptor
Class providing information about XRDisplaySubsystem registration.


XRInputSubsystem
XRInputSubsystem
Instance is used to enable and disable the inputs coming from a specific plugin.


XRInputSubsystemDescriptor
Information about an Input subsystem.


XRMeshSubsystem
Allows external systems to provide dynamic meshes to Unity.


XRMeshSubsystemDescriptor
Information about an XRMeshSubsystem.


XRStats
Provides timing and other statistics from XR subsystems.








Structs








Struct


Description






Bone
A tracked bone on the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem.


Eyes
Contains eye tracking data from the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem.


Hand
A tracked hand on the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem.


HapticCapabilities
Describes the haptic capabilities of the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem.


InputDevice
Defines an input device in the XR input subsystem.


InputFeatureUsage
Defines a generic usage that maps to an input feature on a device. Use the As method to turn into a generic usage.


InputFeatureUsage<T0>
Defines a generic usage that maps to an input feature on a device.


MeshGenerationResult
