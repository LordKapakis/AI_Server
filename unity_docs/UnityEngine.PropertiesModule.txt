 Base class to implement a visitor responsible for getting an object's concrete type as a generic.
 


ContainerPropertyBag<T0>

 Base class for implementing a static property bag for a specified container type. This is an abstract class.
 


CreatePropertyAttribute

 Use this attribute to have a property generated for the member.
 


DelegateProperty<T0,T1>

 Represents a value property.
 


DictionaryPropertyBag<T0,T1>

 An IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a Dictionary_2 type.
 


DontCreatePropertyAttribute

 Use this attribute to prevent have a property from being automatically generated on a public field.
 


GeneratePropertyBagAttribute

 Use this attribute to have the source generator generate property bags for a given type.
 


GeneratePropertyBagsForAssemblyAttribute

 Use this attribute to enable the source generator to run on this assembly.
 


GeneratePropertyBagsForTypeAttribute

 Use this attribute to have the source generator generate a property bag for a given type.
 This attribute works for the specified type ONLY, it does NOT include derived types.
 


GeneratePropertyBagsForTypesQualifiedWithAttribute

 Use this attribute to have the properties source generator generate property bags for types implementing the specified interface.
 


HashSetPropertyBag<T0>

 An IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a HashSet_1 type.
 


IndexedCollectionPropertyBag<T0,T1>

 An IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a generic collection of elements which can be accessed by index. This is based on the IList_1 interface.
 


InvalidContainerTypeException

 The exception that is thrown when trying to visit an invalid container type.
 


InvalidPathException

 The exception that is thrown when trying to resolve an invalid path.
 


KeyValueCollectionPropertyBag<T0,T1,T2>

 An IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a generic collection of key/value pairs using the IDictionary_2 interface.
 


KeyValuePairPropertyBag<T0,T1>

 A IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a generic key/value pair.
 


ListPropertyBag<T0>

 A IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a List_1 type.
 


MissingPropertyBagException

 The exception that is thrown when trying to visit a container with no property bag.
 


PathVisitor

 Helper visitor to visit a single property using a specified PropertyPath.
 


Property<T0,T1>

 Base class for implementing properties. This is an abstract class.
 


PropertyBag

 The PropertyBag class provides access to registered property bag instances.
 


PropertyBag<T0>

 Base class for implementing a property bag for a specified container type. This is an abstract class.
 


PropertyContainer

 The PropertyContainer class is used as the entry point to operate on data containers using properties.
 


PropertyVisitor

 Base class for implementing algorithms using properties. This is an abstract class.
 


ReflectedMemberProperty<T0,T1>

 A ReflectedMemberProperty_2 provides strongly typed access to an underlying FieldInfo or PropertyInfo object.
 


SetPropertyBagBase<T0,T1>

 A IPropertyBag_1 implementation for a generic set of elements using the ISet_1 interface.
 


TypeConversion

 Helper class to handle type conversion during properties API calls.
 


TypeTraits

 Helper class to avoid paying the cost of runtime type lookups.
 


TypeTraits<T0>

 Helper class to avoid paying the cost of runtime type lookups. This is also used to abstract underlying type info in the runtime (e.g. RuntimeTypeHandle vs StaticTypeReg)
