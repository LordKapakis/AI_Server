Description


A module that contains API you can use to interact with NVIDIA graphics cards.






To activate this module at runtime, call NVIDIA.Plugins.LoadPlugin with the NVIDIA.Plugins.Plugin.NVUnityPlugin value during application startup. The class NVIDIA.Device contains the APIs to interact with the graphics cards' specific features.






Classes








Class


Description






DLSSContext
Represents the state of DLSS.


GraphicsDevice
Provides the main entry point for the NVIDIA Module. Use this to interact with specific NVIDIA graphics card features.


GraphicsDeviceDebugView
Represents a memory snapshot of the current feature states. The memory of the arrays/buffers in this struct are tied to the lifetime of the debug view. Additional resources: GraphicsDevice.CreateDebugView, GraphicsDevice.UpdateDebugView and GraphicsDevice.DeleteDebugView.


NVUnityPlugin
Provides methods to manage loading and unloading NVIDIA module plugins.








Structs








Struct


Description






DLSSCommandExecutionData
Represents the state of a DLSSContext. If you call Device.ExecuteDLSS, Unity sends the values in this struct to the runtime. After this, you can change the values in this struct without any side effects.


DLSSCommandInitializationData
Represent the initialization state of a DLSSContext. You can only use and set this when calling GraphicsDevice.CreateFeature.


DLSSDebugFeatureInfos
Represents debug information for a particular DLSSContext.


DLSSTextureTable
The set of texture slots available for the DLSSContext. SA GraphicsDevice.ExecuteDLSS


OptimalDLSSSettingsData
Represents the performance settings that DLSS recommends based on the system's graphics card and the size of the input and output color buffers. Additional resources: GraphicsDevice.GetOptimalSettings








Enumerations








Enumeration


Description






DLSSFeatureFlags
Options that represent subfeatures of DLSS.


DLSSQuality
Options for DLSS performance modes.


GraphicsDeviceFeature
Lists every feature ID the GraphicsDevice API supports. For now, this only includes Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). To check if the device supports a feature, call GraphicsDevice.IsFeatureAvailable.
