AnimationClip

Provides an asset that assigns animation curves to animatable properties.
            


AnimationEvent
AnimationEvent lets you call a script function similar to SendMessage as part of playing back an animation.


AnimationPlayableBinding
A PlayableBinding that contains information representing an AnimationPlayableOutput.


AnimationPlayableOutputExtensions
Static class providing experimental extension methods for AnimationPlayableOutput .


AnimationPlayableUtilities
Implements high-level utility methods to simplify use of the Playable API with Animations.


AnimationSceneHandleUtility
Static class providing utility functions for animation scene handles.


AnimationState
The AnimationState gives full control over animation blending.


AnimationStreamHandleUtility
Static class providing utility functions for animation stream handles.


Animator
Manages, controls, and evaluates the animation of a GameObject.


AnimatorControllerParameter
Used to communicate between scripting and an AnimatorController.


AnimatorJobExtensions
Static class providing extension methods for Animator and the animation C# jobs.


AnimatorOverrideController
Interface to control Animator Override Controller.


AnimatorUtility
Various utilities for animator manipulation.


Avatar
The avatar asset describes the mapping of the character in the Animator.


AvatarBuilder
Class to build avatars from user scripts.


AvatarMask
AvatarMask is used to mask out humanoid body parts and transforms.


DiscreteEvaluationAttribute
Use this attribute to indicate that a property will be evaluated as a discrete value during animation playback.


GenericBindingUtility
Animation utility functions for reading and writing values from Unity components.


HumanPoseHandler
Use this class to create, read, and write the HumanPose for a humanoid avatar skeleton hierarchy or an avatar pose.


HumanTrait
Details of all the human bone and muscle types defined by Mecanim.


LookAtConstraint
Constrains the orientation of a GameObject based on the position of one or more sources.


Motion
Stores a reference to an animation asset associated with a State Machine state.


NotKeyableAttribute
Use this attribute in a script to mark a property as non-animatable.


ParentConstraint
Constrains the transformation of a GameObject based on the position and rotation of one or more sources.


PositionConstraint
Constrains the position of a GameObject based on the position of one or more sources.


RotationConstraint
Constrains the rotation of a GameObject based on the rotation of one or more sources.


RuntimeAnimatorController
A representation of the Animator Controller, optimized for runtime.


ScaleConstraint
Constrains the scale of a GameObject based on the scale of one or more sources.


SharedBetweenAnimatorsAttribute
The SharedBetweenAnimatorsAttribute specifies that this StateMachineBehaviour is instantiated only once and shared by all Animator instances. This attribute reduces the memory footprint for each controller instance.


StateMachineBehaviour
StateMachineBehaviour is a component that you add to a state machine state. It is the base class that a script must derive from.
