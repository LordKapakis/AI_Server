Description



 Options for defining the role of an 
AccessibilityNode
 to
 assistive technologies.
 







 You can use values from this enum to set the
 
AccessibilityNode.role
. This property helps inform
 assistive technologies how to interact with your
 
AccessibilityNode
. Setting accurate roles improves the
 usability and user experience of your UI by enabling assistive
 technologies to set clear expectations for users. A missing role can
 block a user from interacting with your UI, and an incorrect role can
 cause confusion and frustration. You can use the default value,
 
AccessibilityRole.None
, for nodes whose role is not
 described by any of the enum options. Some examples are container
 elements and highly customized controls.

The following example demonstrates assigning an 
AccessibilityRole
 to a
 UI element based on its 
VisualElement
 type.







// Attach this script to a 
UIDocument
 
GameObject
.
// This script demonstrates creating an 
AccessibilityNode
 for each child of a
// 
UIDocument
's rootVisualElement and assigning an appropriate
// 
AccessibilityRole
 based on its 
VisualElement
 type.
// It also shows how to create custom controls to support AccessibilityRoles
// that don't have a corresponding 
VisualElement
 type. These can be used in
// UXML files and the UI 
Builder
.
// To view the properties of the AccessibilityNodes in Playmode, go to
// Window > Accessibility > 
Hierarchy
 Viewer.
