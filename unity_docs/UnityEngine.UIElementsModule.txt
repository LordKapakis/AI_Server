 Inspector elements like PropertyField, which has the style class by default.
 However, if you manually add a child BaseField element to a PropertyField, you must add
 the style class manually.When the style class is present, the field automatically calculates the label width
 to align with other fields in the Inspector window. If there are IMGUI fields present,
 UI Toolkit fields are aligned with them for consistency and compatibility.

 Note: Set the usage hints at edit time or before you add the VisualElement to a panel.
 In the case of transition, when it starts, the system might automatically add missing relevant
